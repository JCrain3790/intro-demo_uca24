        This website is going to my blog for my progress in Arkansas Coding
        Academy. Fair warning that my writing style is very stream of conscious,
        so I might ramble. But I promise there is a point. I'm starting the Fast
        Track Full Stack for the Fall of 2024. So far, we have learned how to
        navigate Debian Linux, how to use HTML, and had a test over HTML terms.
        I have to say, I'm pretty happy with my progress thus far. I've always
        enjoyed computers and have been fascinated with the innerworkings of
        them ever since I bought my first PC in 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I bought my first PC, I've always been Mac user. We had a family
        PC at home when I was growing up, but when I turned 18, I got a Mac book
        before starting college and never looked back. I liked Mac because I was
        getting in to video, and Mac was considered the computer of choice for
        video-enthusiasts. I stuck with them for a while, however in 2015, I
        began to become frustrated with the direction Apple was going with their
        hardware. Ditching legacy ports, as well as widely used ports like
        USB-A, was a move that baffled me. That, along with my increasing
        interest in PC gaming, pushed me in 2020 to buy my own computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of building a computer was still quiet scary at the time, so I
        opted to buy a custom prebuilt from iBUYPOWER. So in September of 2020,
        I bought this:
